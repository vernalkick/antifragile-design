# Antifragile Design

![](http://cl.ly/image/1z1S2M311L2n/1)

This is the site for my talk Antifragile Design. It talks about a lot of the things I've learned in the past 2 years designing products at a large scale.

I'm currently seeking speaking engagements, so if you enjoy it and you'd like me to speak at your conference [let me know](mailto:kevin@kevinclark.ca)!
